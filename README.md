#GENERAL DESCRIPTION: 
 Our app’s purpose is to bring people together based on similar coffee preferences, and help coffee lovers get some variety in their lives by choosing a new drink for them to try at starbucks every day, based on their preferences.  We also have a feed where coffee lovers can post pictures and stories of their favorite drinks and moments.  Users can also see the 10 most recent posts that other users of the app have made.  Up to three new user matches are provided for the user and can be refreshed, and they come with an email so users can get in contact! These matches might have the same location, same favorite drink, or same flavor as the current user. Every time the user logs in, they receive a new drink of the day that aligns with their preferences including but not limited to: Calories, Mg of Caffeine, and Hot/Cold.  Users’ preferences and information is saved due to our implementation of Authentication.
